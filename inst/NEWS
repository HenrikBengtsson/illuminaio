  which is now BioC v2.14 for R (>= 3.1.0).
 

Version: 0.5.6 [2014-03-10]
o Added a CITATION file, cf. citation("illuminaio").


Version: 0.5.5 [2014-01-19]
o Added support for encrypted IDAT files where not all data fields are of the
  same length e.g. HumanHap550 v1.


Version: 0.5.2 [2013-11-05]
o moved testData to IlluminaDataTestFiles.
o Added unitTests for encrypted IDATs.


Version: 0.5.1 [2013-11-04]
o Resshuffled internal code in readIDAT_nonenc so that seek() is always forward based.

Version: 0.5.0 [2013-10-14; BioC 2.14]
o The version number was bumped for the Bioconductor devel version.
o No updates.


Version: 0.4.0 [2013-10-14; BioC 2.13]
o The version number was bumped for the Bioconductor release version.
o No updates.


Version: 0.3.9 [2013-09-13]
o Added vignette giving examples of usage and demonstrating comparison
  with GenomeStudio output;


Version: 0.3.8 [2013-09-12]
o Bug fixes, renaming of readIDAT_bin to readIDAT_nonenc.


Version: 0.3.6 [2013-08-21]
o Added one parent function readIDAT which checks file format
  and dispatches to the relevant subfunction.


Version: 0.3.5 [2013-08-02]
o Cleaned up internal code of readBPM().
o ROBUSTNESS: Added unit tests for readBPM().  Note that these are
  only run if environment variable '_R_CHECK_FULL_' is set, i.e.
  they will *not* be perfomed on the Bioconductor servers.


Version: 0.3.0 [2013-04-03; BioC 2.13]
o The version number was bumped for the Bioconductor devel version.

Version: 0.1.3 [2012-11-12]
o Added system tests for readIDAT() on example files from 'hapmap370k' package.


Version: 0.1.2 [2012-11-07]
o Now readIDAT() guarantees to close any connections it opens.  
  Also tidied up its code by defining local read functions.


Version: 0.1.1 [2012-1]
