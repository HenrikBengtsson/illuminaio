Package: illuminaio
===================

Version: 0.23.1-9000 [2018-07-18]

NEW FEATURES:

 o The readIDAT() function gains a 'what' argument (only for unencrypted IDAT
   files).  This allows the fast return of the number of 'nSNPsRead' (number
   of probes in file) and 'IlluminaID' (probenames). This is to allow fast
   handling of IDAT files in the minfi package.

   if environment variable '_R_CHECK_FULL_' is set, i.e. they will *not* be
   performed on the Bioconductor servers.
